                                            <p>We’re Morhover rating health and medical-related policies into an easy-to-navigate page.</p>
                                            <p>We’re clarifying our Ads policy to emphasize that ads and their associated offers served in your app must be consistent with your app's content rating.</p>
                                            <p>We’re clarifying our Ads policy to state that the Ad ID may no longer be connected to a persistent identifier or personally-identifiable information for any purpose including analytics purposes.</p>
                                            <p>We’re clarifying the Made For Ads guidelines under our Spam policy to prevent apps from displaying interstitial ads repeatedly to distract users from engaging with an app and performing in-app tasks.</p>
                                            <p>We’re moving country-specific guidelines from our Real-Money Gambling, Games, and Contests policy page to a link on our Gambling Application Form for easier reference.</p>
                                            <p>We’re clarifying our sensitive events definition and examples under the Inappropriate Content policy to state that we don’t allow apps that capitalize on or are insensitive toward a sensitive event with significant social, cultural, or political impact (for example, civil emergencies, natural disasters, public health emergencies, conflicts, deaths, or other tragic events).</p>
                                            <p>We're clarifying Privacy Policy guidelines under our User Data policy to state that all apps must post a privacy policy link in the designated field within Play Console and a privacy policy link or text within the app itself. We’re also specifying that privacy policies must be publicly accessible and non-geofenced.</p><p>
